# Iteration 2:

* **Assumed Velocity:**  
  Number of developers (4) × productive hours per day (5) × total days in iteration (8) × focus factor (~60%) ÷ hours per story point (4)  
  = (4 × 5 × 8 × 0.6) ÷ 4 = **24 story points**
* **Number of developers:** 4  
* **Total estimated amount of work:** 20 days
  
User stories or tasks (see chapter 4): [user story or task title](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority XX, YY days 
1. User story 1 (Transaction info saving) (Priority High) (Days: 5)
2. User story 2 (Dynamic budget) (Priority High) (Days: 5)


In progress: * Task-2 (developer name or initials), date started
* User story 5 (Transactions filtering) (Date Started: 3 Aug 2025 )
* User story 7 (Overspending alerts) (Date Started: 3 Aug 2025 )
 


Completed: * Task-3 (developer name or initials), date completed
* User story 4 (Goals list) (Date Completed: 1 Aug 2025)
* User story 6 (Transaction summary/spending analysis) (Date Completed: 3 Aug 2025 )
 

### Burn Down for iteration-2 (see chapter 4):
* <img width="1580" height="880" alt="burndown2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ff978f4-8b4f-4ce5-89f7-f9dac859759c" />

Update this at least once per week, each iteration lasts around 3-4 weeks for now 
* 4 week(s), **20 days** of estimated amount of work
* 2 week(s), **8 days** 
* 1 week(s) left, **6 days**
* 0 week(s) left, **1 day**
* Actual Velocity: **17 days ÷ 2 weeks = 8.5 days/week**


### Retrospective

### What went well? 

1. When collaborating with groupmates in GitHub, the branches made it easier to work simultaneously; we could commit code to a branch and eventually merge it once we were ready 
2. When holding a meeting from Scrum, we were all punctual and communicated our goals as well as difficulties well to each other, which made troubleshooting a group effort and more efficient.

#### What problems did we face?

1. Some members had different versions of GitHub, desktop app, local version, or the web version, which made troubleshooting confusing, as sometimes the committing and pushing or merging got desync
2. Time constraints were evident when working on user stories due to other projects in our team members' schedules, which resulted in us dropping some user stories we found less crucial for functionality
3. Even when branches were used, there were still merging issues

#### Learning and action items

1. We spent a lot of time solving the merging issue and updating ourselves on the code formatting and what we were doing. 
2. Spacing out user stories and their functionalities gave us ample time to work between our schedules and together.
