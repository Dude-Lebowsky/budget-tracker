# Iteration 1:

* Assumed Velocity: no. of developers (4) * productive hours a day (5) * total days (8)* focus factor (~60%) / 4-6 for hour per story point
  (4 * 5 * ~8 * 0.6 /4) = ~24
* Number of developers: 4
* Total estimated amount of work: 10 days

User stories or tasks (see chapter 4): [user story or task title](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority XX, YY days 
1. ### User story 1 (Transaction info saving) (Priority High) (Days: 5)
2. ### User story 2 (Dynamic budget) (Priority High) (Days: 5)


In progress: * Task-2 (developer name or initials), date started
* ### User story 1 (Transaction info saving) (Name: ) (Date Started: 4 June 2025)
* ### User story 2 (Dynamic budget) (Name: ) (Date Started: 4 June 2025)


Completed: * Task-3 (developer name or initials), date completed
* ### User story 1 (Transaction info saving) (Name: ) (Date Completed: TBC)
* ### User story 2 (Dynamic budget) (Name: ) (Date Completed: TBC)


### Burn Down for iteration-1 (see chapter 4):
(we can just commit a screenshot for burn down and add the link here) (burn down is a graph)
* ![Example](burn_down_graphs/iteration1_burndown_chart.png) (this is just an example)
Update this at least once per week, each iteration lasts around 3-4 weeks for now 
* 4 week(s), xx days of estimated amount of work 
* 2 week(s), xx days
* 1 week(s) left, xx days
* 0 week(s) left, xx days
* Actual Velocity: ?? 

### Retrospective

### What went well? 

1. The initial coding process was smooth and, we were able to work together efficiently
2. The code also was relatively easy to troubleshoot and its functionalities work fairly well
3. The user stories chosen were very important to the functionality and we got them working

#### What problems did we face?

1. During the break we were working on other projects/subjects hence there is 1 user story not done
2. Working with GitHub had its difficulties as we had to coordinate times as to avoid merging issues
3. In the earlier stages of iteration 1, we were unsure on what had to be done, so some time was taken away to recoup out thoughts and direction
4. When commiting the code for the interface, there were commit issues and all had to be done in 1 commit statement

#### Learning and action items 

1. Working simultaneously got easier when we remembered that we could commit to branches and eventually merge to the main instead of commiting straight to the main branch 
2. We also should have better communication when working together in the form of regular scheduled meetings to inform one another on the changes, and their commitments to the branch
3. Better time management could be done to avoid big downtime inbetween updates to avoid long-winded meetings
4.
