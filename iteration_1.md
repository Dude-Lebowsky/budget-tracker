* Assumed Velocity: no. of developers (4) * productive hours a day (5) * total days (8)* focus factor (~60%) / 4-6 for hour per story point
  (4 * 5 * ~8 * 0.6 /4) = ~24
* Number of developers: 4
* Total estimated amount of work: 10 days

User stories or tasks (see chapter 4): [user story or task title](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority XX, YY days 
1. ### User story 1 (Transaction info saving) (Priority High) (Days: 5)
2. ### User story 2 (Dynamic budget) (Priority High) (Days: 5)


In progress: * Task-2 (developer name or initials), date started
* ### User story 1 (Transaction info saving) (Name: ) (Date Started: 4 June 2025)
* ### User story 2 (Dynamic budget) (Name: ) (Date Started: 4 June 2025)


Completed: * Task-3 (developer name or initials), date completed
* ### User story 1 (Transaction info saving) (Name: ) (Date Completed: TBC)
* ### User story 2 (Dynamic budget) (Name: ) (Date Completed: TBC)


### Burn Down for iteration-1 (see chapter 4):
(we can just commit a screenshot for burn down and add the link here) (burn down is a graph)
* ![Example](burn_down_graphs/Burn_Down_Example.png) (this is just an example)
Update this at least once per week, each iteration lasts around 3-4 weeks for now 
* 4 week(s), xx days of estimated amount of work 
* 2 week(s), xx days
* 1 week(s) left, xx days
* 0 week(s) left, xx days
* Actual Velocity: ??
