# Project Name: Budget Tracker

## Project Overview:
This project involves developing a user-friendly Budget Tracker application that helps individuals manage their personal finances by tracking income, expenses, and savings goals. The tool will provide real-time insights into spending habits and offer a clear overview of financial health, driven by data entered by the user. The development is guided by user stories to ensure the product meets practical, real-world needs.

## Goals
1. Enable Transaction Recording
Allow users to store key transaction details—description, date, and amount—to track their spending accurately.

2. Support Dynamic Budget Management
Provide functionality for users to create, edit, and monitor budgets, with automatic deduction of transactions from the set budget.

3. Allow Categorization of Transactions
Let users assign categories (e.g., rent, groceries) to transactions for better organization and insights into spending habits.

4. Manage and Track Savings Goals
Enable users to define saving goals (e.g., retirement, vacation) with descriptions and target amounts to stay motivated and measure progress.

5. Filter Transactions by Criteria
Implement filters for category, date, and amount to help users sort and group transactions effectively.
